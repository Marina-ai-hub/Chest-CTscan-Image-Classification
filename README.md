# Chest-CTscan-Image-Classification
Chest CT-Scan Image Classification

Built CNN models to detect chest cancer from CT scan images. Built a custom CNN with multiple convolution and pooling layers, and applied transfer learning with pretrained networks: Xception, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ConvNeXtTiny, EfficientNetV2L.
